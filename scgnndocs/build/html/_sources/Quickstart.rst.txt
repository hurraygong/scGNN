Quikly Run scGNN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
scGNN: a novel graph neural network model for single-cell transcriptome analysis. This is an example of the scGNN, just for quickly running it. If see detail process, view the preprocessing, advanced, downstream file. In this part, we go through 3 steps to show the run process.

        1.Install scGNN
        2.Download data
        3.Run scGNN
