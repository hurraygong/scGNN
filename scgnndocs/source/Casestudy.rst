AD case datasets
To further demonstrate the applicative power of scGNN, we applied it to a scRNA-Seq dataset (GEO accession number GSE138852) containing 13,214 single nuclei collected from six AD and six control brains.

AD case datasets can be downloaded from GEO databases with accession numbers of `GSE138852 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138852>`_ (AD case).
