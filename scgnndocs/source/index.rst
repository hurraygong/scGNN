**scGNN** (single cell graph neural networks) provides a hypothesis-free deep learning framework for scRNA-Seq analyses. This framework formulates and aggregates cell-cell relationships with graph neural networks and models heterogeneous gene expression patterns using a left-truncated mixture Gaussian model. scGNN integrates three iterative multi-modal autoencoders and outperforms existing tools for gene imputation and cell clustering on four benchmark scRNA-Seq datasets.

This repository contains the source code for the paper scGNN: a novel graph neural network framework for single-cell RNA-Seq analyses preprint available at bioRxiv; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.02.233569
